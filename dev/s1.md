Backlog
=======
- Json schema validation (when slave connects?)
  Validate json schema to avoid storing or pulling unknown data

- Multiple storage per Master

- Storage ID as String

- Multiple concurrent slave

- Storage lock mechanism
  Ensure only one sync or write operation can occur in the same time.

- Fast client sync
  Client sync must be as fast as it can. Lock mechanism, serialization protocol and communication protocol
  should support this goal. Incremental data sync should be part of this.

- Incremental client sync (to optimize speed)
  The client should store a local database copy. To perform incremental syncs, the client provides its local commit ID and pull changes made after that commit.
